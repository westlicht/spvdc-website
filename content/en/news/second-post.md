Dear Customers,

During the preparation of our new online presentation, we have also revised and updated our coating data sheets. Slight modifications were made to some names in the process: AlTiN-MDT has now been abbreviated to AlTiN.

We are proud to be able to present the following newly developed coatings to you:


| Schicht | Bezeichnung |
| ------- | ----------- |
| TiCX    | On the basis of TiC, a real alternative to DLC coatings |
| AlTiX   | On the basis of AlTiN, with outstanding results during drilling |
| AlCrO   | On the basis of AlCrN, for use under very high application temperatures |

You will find further information on our coatings on the website. We would naturally be pleased to also advise you personally on our range of coatings.

Yours sincerely,
The team from swiss-PVD Coating AG
