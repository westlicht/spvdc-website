Dear Customers,

During the preparation of our new online presentation, we have also revised and updated our coating data sheets. Slight modifications were made to some names in the process: AlTiN-MDT has now been abbreviated to AlTiN.

We are proud to be able to present the following newly developed coatings to you:

| Schicht | Bezeichnung |
| ------- | ----------- |
| TiCX    | Developped on the basis of TiC, a real alternative to DLC coatings |
| AlTiX   | Developped on the basis of AlTiN, with outstanding results during drilling |
| AlCrO   | Developped on the basis of AlCrN, for use under very high application temperatures |

You will find further information about coatings on the website. Alternatively, we would  be pleased to advise you personally on our range of coatings.

Yours sincerely,
The swiss-PVD Coating team
