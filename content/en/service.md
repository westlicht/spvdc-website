  title: Incoming Goods
  body: |
    Incoming Goods receives new orders, examines them for completeness and clarity and defines the necessary processing steps. Competent and flexible employees check the customers’ wishes and, where necessary, clarify special requirements with Production and our customers. Incoming Goods lays the basis for quick and fault-free execution of the orders.

  title: Demagnetisation
  body: |
    Conductive metals tend to become magnetic when processed (grinding, bending, cutting, deep drawing, etc.) or held with magnets. Even after successful demagnetisation in the customer’s works, parts can become magnetically charged again during transport. Demagnetisation is particularly important for miniature tools in order to reduce their attraction for chips and dust, but also to ensure that no undesirable differences in thickness occur during coating.

  title: Cleaning
  body: |
    Thorough cleaning is indispensable for optimum adhesion of the coating. Residues such as oils prevent the chemical bonding of the layer and can lead to spalling. In our fully automated ultrasonic cleaning lines, we use CFC-free, alkaline cleaning products. Each line has its own water treatment unit to ensure consistently high cleaning results. Where soiling is difficult to remove (diamond paste, plastic residues, etc.) we recommend precleaning by wet pressure spraying.

  title: Decoating
  body: |
    In our chemical decoating baths, we can remove undesirable or faulty PVD coatings on steel and carbide metal residue-free. (The removal of chrome-based coatings is more problematical, however, particularly on carbide metal surfaces.) The tools remain sharp and the cutting edge geometry intact. For decorative applications we recommend polishing of the parts after decoating, as even the slightest changes in the surface can lead to minor deviations in the colour finish.

  title: Pretreatment
  body: |
    We employ special micro shot blasting and wet pressure spraying methods to stabilise cutting edges on carbide tools subject to high loads and for optimum substrate preparation of tool and part surfaces. This applies in particular to oxidised, contaminated and spark-eroded surfaces, as well as carbide metal surfaces with cobalt elution.

  title: Coating
  body: |
    For coating, the individual parts are placed in a suitable holder and positioned on the carousel (the loading station) so that they are optimally aligned with the coating source. The bracket defines whether and, if so, in which axis the part to be coated is rotated in the machine during the coating process. The PVD machine is computer-controlled and monitored automatically during the whole process. In the first step, a high vacuum is generated and the parts are heated to coating temperature. The surfaces are subsequently activated by physical etching. During coating, the desired metals are evaporated in the arc and react with the selectively supplied gases. The evaporated material condenses on the parts to be coated and a thin, uniform layer with the desired composition is formed.

  title: Post-treatment
  body: |
    PVD coating results in a process-inherent increase in the surface roughness. Droplets of the evaporated metal settles on the part surface. During the post-treatment, droplets are removed and hence the part surface polished and the anti-friction behaviour improved. A wide range of methods are used for post-treatment. We have the corresponding blasting machines and polishing machines as well as trained personnel for manual polishing.

  title: Quality assurance
  body: |
    The high level of quality of our coatings is ensured by standardised quality tests to determine the coat thickness, coat structure, coat colour and coat adhesion. For this purpose, test pieces or test tools are included in every coating batch and examined according to the specifications of our Quality Management before the batch is released.

  title: Outgoing goods
  body: |
    After the release by Quality Assurance, the individual parts are taken from the loading station (carousel) and inspected visually (using a light microscope, if necessary). Outgoing Goods also checks whether all the parts have undergone the processing steps defined by Incoming Goods. Finished parts are degreased, if necessary, and subsequently packed. The customer’s packaging material is generally used for the return shipment (this is selected by the customer to ensure the best possible protection for the parts and unnecessary waste can be avoided). Depending on the customer’s wishes, the customer is advised that the parts can be collected or the package is sent to the appropriate transport channel.
