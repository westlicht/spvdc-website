  title: Incoming Orders
  body: |
    Incoming Orders receives new client requests, examines them for completeness and clarity and defines the necessary processing steps. Experienced and flexible employees check the client's wishes and, where necessary, clarify special requirements. Incoming Orders lays the groundwork for quick and precise execution of your specifications.

  title: Demagnetisation
  body: |
    Conductive metals tend to become magnetic when processed (grinding, bending, cutting, deep drawing, etc.) or when held with magnets. Even after successful demagnetisation, parts can become magnetically charged again during transport to our facility. Demagnetisation is particularly important for miniature tools in order to reduce their tendendy to chip and collect dust, and also to ensure that no undesirable differences in thickness occur during coating.

  title: Cleaning
  body: |
    Thorough cleaning is indispensable for optimum adhesion of the coating. Residues such as oils prevent the chemical bonding and can lead to flaking. In our fully automated ultrasonic cleaning lines, we use CFC-free, alkaline cleaning products. Each line has its own water treatment unit to ensure consistently high cleaning results. Where dirt is difficult to remove (diamond paste, plastic residues, etc.) we recommend precleaning by wet pressure blasting.

  title: Decoating
  body: |
    In our chemical decoating baths, we can remove undesirable or faulty PVD coatings on steel and carbide metal. The removal of chrome-based coatings is more problematic, however, particularly on carbide metal surfaces. The tools remain sharp with the blade edge intact. For decorative applications we recommend polishing the parts after decoating, as even the slightest changes in the surface can lead to minor deviations in the colour finish.

  title: Pre-treatment
  body: |
    For optimum substrate preparation of tool and part surfaces we employ special micro shot blasting and wet pressure blasting methods to stabilise blades edges on carbide tools that are subject to high loads. aThis applies in particular to oxidised, contaminated and spark-eroded surfaces, as well as carbide metal surfaces with cobalt elution.

  title: Coating
  body: |
    For coating, the individual parts are placed in a suitable holder and positioned on the carousel (the loading station) so that they are optimally aligned with the coating source. Correct bracket selection determines how the part is rotated in the machine during the coating process, ensuring optimal coating. The PVD machine is computer-controlled throughout the process. In the first step, a high pressure vacuum is generated and the parts are heated to coating temperature. The surfaces are subsequently activated by physical etching. During coating, the desired metals are evaporated and react with the selectively supplied gases. The evaporated material condenses on the parts to be coated and a thin, uniform layer with the desired composition is formed.

  title: Post-treatment
  body: |
    PVD coating results in a process-inherent increase in the surface roughness. Droplets of the evaporated metal settles on the part surface. During the post-treatment, the droplets are removed thereby polishing the surface and improving the anti-friction behaviour. A wide range of methods are used for post-treatment for which we have the corresponding blasting machines and polishing machines as well as trained personnel for manual polishing.

  title: Quality assurance
  body: |
    The high level of quality of our coatings is ensured by standardised quality tests to determine the coating thickness, structure, colour and adhesion. Test pieces or test tools are included in every coating batch and examined according to our Quality Management specifications before the batch is released.

  title: Outgoing Orders
  body: |
    After passing through our Quality Assurance processes, the individual parts are taken from the loading station (carousel) and inspected visually (using a light microscope, if necessary). Outgoing Orders also checks whether all the parts have undergone the processing steps specified by the client. Finished parts are greased, if necessary, and subsequently packed. The client's own packaging material is generally used for the return shipment. This is to ensure the best possible protection for the parts and to avoid unnecessary waste. We can also accommodate clients who wish to collect orders from our facilities.
