AlTiCrN has a very high hot hardness and oxidation resistance, as well as very good toughness and a smooth surface quality thanks to its fine nanostructure. The coating can be used without post-treatment, a great benefit for delicate tools and precision machining operations.

AlTiCrN is used for the cutting of materials with a cold welding tendency.
