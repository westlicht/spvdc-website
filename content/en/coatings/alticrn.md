Thanks to its fine nanostructure, AlTiCrN has extremely high heat and oxidation resistance, as well as good toughness and a smooth surface quality. The coating can be used without post-treatment, a great benefit for delicate tools and precision machining operations.

AlTiCrN is used for the cutting of materials with a cold-welding tendency.
