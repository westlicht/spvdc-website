Our new development, AlCrO, is optimised for the highest temperatures and thermal shock stability. The high-energy density during deposition increases the bonding strength; the density and cohesion of this coating is a new standard for PVD coatings. Thanks to the chrome content, AlCrO can be easily polished, resulting in an exceptionally smooth and low-distortion surface quality and outstanding anti-adhesion behaviour during use. The fine-grained nanostructure gives the coating enormous toughness even under extreme operating conditions, and low “atomic” wear rates mean minimal cutting edge fractures.

With fine-grained carbide tools of the highest quality, AlCrO achieves enormous improvements in performance during hard and dry machining (MQL) and high-speed cutting. AlCrO is also recommended for gear hobbing, turning, fine blanking and metal forming. With the polished fine surface quality, AlCrO is also suitable for the milling, thread cutting and forming, and reaming of stainless steel and titanium alloys.
