Our new development, AlCrO, is optimised for the highest hot hardness and thermal shock stability. The high energy density during deposition increases the bonding strength, density and cohesion of this coating to a new level for PVD coatings. Thanks to the chrome content, AlCrO can be very easily polished, resulting in a very smooth and low-distortion surface quality that is reflected in outstanding anti-adhesion behaviour during use. The fine-grained nanostructure gives the coating enormous toughness that is reflected even under extreme operating conditions in “atomic” wear rates without the slightest tendency to cutting edge fractures.

With fine-grained carbide tools of the highest quality, AlCrO achieves enormous improvements in performance during hard and dry machining (MQL) and high-speed cutting. AlCrO is also to be recommended for gear hobbing, turning, fine blanking and metal forming. With the polished fine surface quality, AlCrO is also suitable for the milling, thread cutting and reaming of stainless steel and titanium alloys.
