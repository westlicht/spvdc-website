TiCN is a further development of TiN and has enabled a significant boost in performance. The coating is characterised by its hardness and toughness, and its anti-friction and anti-adhesion properties. It is ideal for tools made from tool steel that are subject to high mechanical loads.

It is often used in thread cutting and forming, gear hobbing, broaching, sawing, forming and blanking of stainless steel, and in the injection moulding of carbon fibre or glassfibre-reinforced plastics. Attention must be paid to its limited heat resistance.
