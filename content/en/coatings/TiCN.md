TiCN is a further development of TiN and has enabled a further significant boost in performance for steel tools subject to high mechanical loads. The coating is characterised by its high hardness and toughness, and it has very good anti-friction and anti-adhesion properties. It is very suitable for tools of tool steel subject to high mechanical loads.

It is often used in thread cutting, gear hobbing, broaching, sawing, forming and blanking of stainless steel, and in the injection moulding of carbon fibre or glassfibre-reinforced plastics. Attention must be paid to the limited heat resistance.
