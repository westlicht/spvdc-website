AL(L) is characterised by its high thermal stability and oxidation resistance. The nanolayer structure of the coating provides an optimum balance between intrinsic stress, hardness and fracture resistance that prevents the formation and propagation of micro cracks. Thanks to the silicon content, AL(L) has a glass hard surface with good anti-friction properties and a low tendency to stick to the machined workpiece material.

AL(L) is successful in the cutting of difficult materials, such as hardened steel, stainless steel, cast iron, titanium, and nickel alloys. Stable and vibration-free working conditions are important for this coating. The benefits of AL(L) come particularly to the fore during deep hole drilling, and during drilling without cooling lubricant, or when using minimal  lubrication.
