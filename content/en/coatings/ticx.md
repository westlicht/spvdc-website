TiCX is a real alternative for applications where only DLC coatings could be successfully used to date. The coating is our new development of 2016 and surpasses TiCN with respect to hardness and toughness. It is characterised in particular by outstanding anti-friction and anti-adhesion properties.

Maximum performance is achieved with TiCX during fine blanking and forming of stainless steel, and during thread cutting and forming on alloyed and corrosion-resistant steels. TiCX is also the coating of choice for gear hobbing, broaching and sawing with tools of high-speed steel, and for the injection moulding of carbon fibre or glassfibre-reinforced plastics.
