AlTiN has a high heat and oxidation resistance, as well as great toughness and a smooth surface quality thanks to its fine nanostructure. This coating is therefore ideal for tools and components that are subject to high thermal loads. AlTiN is a good choice for applications with high cutting speeds and also for hard and dry machining (MQL).

The coating offers improvements in performance for tools that are subject to high loads during drilling, milling, turning, gear hobbing, fine blanking, and metal forming. Thanks to the fine nanostructure and the high surface quality, AlTiN is also suitable for micro drills and miniature tools.
