AlTiN has a very high hot hardness and oxidation resistance, as well as very good toughness and a smooth surface quality thanks to its fine nanostructure. This coating is therefore ideal for tools and parts subject to high thermal loads. AlTiN is a good choice for applications with high cutting speeds and also for hard and dry machining (MQL).

The coating offers improvements in performance for tools subject to high loads during drilling, milling, turning, gear hobbing, fine blanking and during metal forming. Thanks to the fine nanostructure and the good surface quality, AlTiN is also suitable for micro drills and miniature tools.
