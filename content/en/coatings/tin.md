TiN is the first (and was for many years the only) PVD wear protection coating with such a wide range of applications to meet a vast array of demands. Due to its bright golden yellow colour, TiN was initially used for decorative purposes. Then test coatings for cutting tools made from tool steel, and metal forming tools made from cold and hot working steels followed. TiN achieved multiple tool lives and more attractive workpieces compared with uncoated tools, and hence kicked of the success story of the PVD technology.

As an all-round coating, TiN is suitable for cutting and forming iron-based materials and is also used in the injection moulding of plastics and in the die casting of zinc. Today TiN is still often preferred for slow-running and/or unstable machine conditions for drilling and milling operations because, in addition to its hardness, it also has outstanding toughness and withstands vibrations without cracking or flaking. TiN is also used in the food industry and in medical technology.
