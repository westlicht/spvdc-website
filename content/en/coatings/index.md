Coating recommendations for different applications and operating conditions are not easy to give and should be implemented by the users with certain reservations. In order to save costs and to achieve a fast result, newly developed coatings are generally tested under extreme application conditions. Their superiority over conventional coatings are thus validated even under these “extreme conditions” in accordance with strict statistical rules.

When selecting a wear protection coating for a certain application, you are well-advised to orient yourself to the proven conventional methods and to take the new recommendation for serious comparison tests. If in doubt, please [contact us](/en/contact). We will be happy to advise you.

__Important note:__ In addition to the choice of the right coating, the right pretreatment and post-treatment are essential for a successful application. This applies in particular for fine-grained carbide tools for hard and dry machining (MQL - Minimum Quantity Lubrication) and for deep hole drilling.
