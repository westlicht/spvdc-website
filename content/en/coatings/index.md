  #### Important notes

  In addition to the choice of the right coating, the right pre-treatment and post-treatment is essential for a successful application. This applies in particular to fine-grained carbide tools for hard and dry machining (MQL) and for deep hole drilling.

  The coating thickness should be chosen carefully depending on the tool and its application area. A thickness of 2-4 µm is applied by default. However, it's recommended to apply thinner coatings of 0.5-2µm for micro tools with a diameter of less than 3mm to ensure high cutting efficiency. Thinner coatings smoother and that's why they are highly recommended for reamers.

As numerous factors can influence coating results, recommendations for different applications and operating conditions are not simple to give. Newly developed coatings are tested under extreme application conditions to validate their superiority over conventional coatings. Thus, the newest coatings might not always be the right fit.

When selecting wear protection coating for a particular application, our helpful online tool is a good place to start. There you can see the proven conventional methods and to take the new recommendation for serious comparison tests. If in doubt, please [contact us](/en/contact). We will be happy to advise you.
