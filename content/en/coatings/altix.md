AlTiX is our new development with an optimised microstructure. Compared with conventional AlTiN coatings, this results in a significantly higher density, hardness and toughness, as well as  improved blade edge stability and abrasion resistance. This optimisations are of particular value when it comes to very delicate applications and steel grades that are difficult to machine.

AlTiX achieves enormous improvements in performance for fine-grained carbide tools used in high-speed cutting,  hard and dry machining (MQL), and deep hole drilling. AlTiX also delivers improved service life in fine blanking and mouldmaking. The excellent bonding strength is very beneficial in an number of application, e.g. for resharpened tools, as lack of bonding strength often leads to deteriorations in quality.
