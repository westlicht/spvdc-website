AlTiX is our new development with an optimised microstructure. Compared with conventional AlTiN coatings, this results in a significantly higher density, hardness and toughness, as well as an improved cutting edge stability and abrasion resistances. This optimisations are particularly noticeable when it comes to very delicate applications and steel grades that are difficult to machine.

AlTiX achieves enormous improvements in performance for fine-grained carbide tools for high-speed cutting, for hard and dry machining (MQL) and for deep hole drilling. AlTiX also scores with improved service lives in fine blanking and mouldmaking. The excellent bonding strength is very beneficial i.a. for resharpened tools, as this criterion very often leads to deteriorations in quality here.
