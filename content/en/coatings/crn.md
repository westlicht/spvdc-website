Due to its lack of affinity to most materials, this is the PVD coating with the least tendency to stick. CrN is characterised by its good corrosion resistance that is comparable with that of hard chrome plating. Compared with hard chrome, however, CrN has a significantly higher hardness and bonding strength. The coating is very easy to polish so that a particularly dense and smooth surface can be achieved. It is furthermore resistant to fluorine, chlorine and other aggressive substances.

CrN is the best metallic coating for the injection moulding of plastics and in delicate applications often demonstrates a better demoulding behaviour than that of the low-friction coatings. CrN is also very well-suited for use in mouldmaking for the processing of special metals such as copper, brass, bronze, nickel silver, galvanised or tin-plated sheet steel. CrN is also proven in the die casting of aluminium and zinc, as well as in the warm forming of steel and brass. The coating is also successfully used in the foodstuffs industry and for parts in the motor sports and aerospace industry.
