Due to its lack of chemical affinity to most materials, this is the PVD coating with the tendency to stick the least. CrN is characterised by its good corrosion resistance, which is comparable with that of hard chrome plating. However, compared with hard chrome, CrN is significantly harder and has a greater bonding strength. As the coating is very easy to polish, a  particularly dense and smooth surface can be achieved. Furthermore, it is resistant to fluorine, chlorine and other corrosive substances.

CrN is the best metallic coating for injection moulding of plastics, and, in delicate applications, often demonstrates better demoulding behaviour than that of other low-friction coatings. CrN is also very well-suited for mouldmaking in the processing of special metals such as copper, brass, bronze, nickel silver, galvanised or tin-plated sheet steel. CrN is also proven effective for die casting aluminium and zinc, as well as in warm forming of steel and brass. The coating is also used in the food industry and in the motorsports and aerospace industries.
