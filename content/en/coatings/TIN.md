TiN is the first and was for many years the only PVD wear protection coating with such a wide range of fields of application to meet a vast array of demand profiles. Due to its bright golden yellow colour, TiN was initially used for decorative purposes. Test coatings for cutting tools made from tool steel and for metal forming tools or cold and hot working steels followed, where TiN achieved multiple tool lives and “more attractive” workpieces time and again compared with uncoated tools, and hence initiated the success story of the PVD technology.

As an all-round coating, TiN is suitable for cutting and forming of iron-based materials and is also used in the injection moulding of plastics and in the die casting of zinc. Today TiN is still often preferred for slow-running and/or unstable machine conditions for drilling and milling operations because in addition to its good hard toughness, it also has outstanding ductility and withstands vibrations without cracking or spalling. TiN is also used in the foodstuffs industry and in medical technology.
